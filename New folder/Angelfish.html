						</table> <span>There are around 100 different species of angelfish
							that inhabit the waters of the southern hemisphere. There are two
							main types of angelfish, those that live in the freshwater rivers
							in South America (freshwater angelfish) and those angelfish that
							inhabit the salty ocean waters (marine angelfish).
							<p>The freshwater angelfish has a more triangular shape and
								will generally only grow to a few inches in length. The marine
								angelfish can grow up to 12 inches (the same length as a big
								ruler) and generally have very brightly coloured markings but
								the exact colours depend on the angelfish species.
							<p>

								Both the freshwater</a> angelfish and the marine angelfish are known
								to be relatively difficult fish to keep in household aquariums,
								as both types of angelfish require very specific water
								conditions. Angelfish are very susceptible to changes in the
								water such as salt levels and pH levels, and will often die if
								changes are too drastic.
							<p>Despite the fact that their names are the same, freshwater
								angelfish and marine angelfish are not thought to be closely
								related. The freshwater angelfish is a tropical species of
								cichlid , distantly related to the cichlids found in specific
								lakes in Africa . The marine angelfish are believed to be most
								closely related to the butterfly fish.
							<p>Freshwater angelfish are native to the Amazon basin and
								are also found in the rivers running off it. Freshwater
								angelfish inhabit the cleaner waters and prefer to be in
								temperatures between 25 and 30 degrees centigrade.
							<p>Freshwater angelfish lay between 100 and 1,000 eggs which
								hatch in just a couple of days. Freshwater angelfish tend to lay
								their eggs on a flat leaf or an underwater log. The baby
								angelfish (known as fry) remain attached to the eggs for another
								week and feed off the remaining yolk in the egg sack. When they
								are bigger at a week old, the angelfish fry detach from their
								eggs and become free swimming. It is at this stage that the baby
								angelfish begin feeding from nutrients in the water and on
								plants.
							<p>The triangular shape of the freshwater angelfish, means
								that the angelfish is able to hide more easily amongst the
								aquatic plants in the water. Wild freshwater angelfish have very
								distinctive dark stripes that run vertically down their bodies,
								giving the freshwater angelfish the ability to blend in to it\'s
								surroundings. Freshwater angelfish usually breed for life and it
								is often found that if one of the angelfish parents dies, then
								the remaining angelfish parent has no interest in breeding.
							<p>Freshwater angelfish feed on smaller fish and
								invertebrates in their natural environment as well as eating
								particles of food found in the water. The freshwater angelfish
								is preyed upon by larger species of fish , birds and marine
								mammals.
							<p>Marine angelfish are generally found in shallow reefs in
								depths of up to 50 meters. Marine angelfish are reported to be
								almost fearless and are noted to be inquisitive and curious
								towards divers. Some species of marine angelfish are solitary by
								nature where other species of angelfish form territorial mating
								pairs or even groups. The groups of marine angelfish usually
								have one male and a number of females.
							<p>Unlike the freshwater angelfish, marine angelfish lay
								their tiny eggs straight into the water. The angelfish eggs
								float in the sea, becoming mixed in with the plankton, until
								they hatch. Unfortunately a vast number of marine angelfish eggs
								are inadvertently eaten by those many animals that feed on the
								plankton in the water.
							<p>Marine angelfish are most well known for the bright colors
								and patterns on their bodies. Marine angelfish vary in colour
								and size depending on the species of marine angelfish, although
								it is known that the patterns and colours of marine angelfish
								change drastically as they get older. It is believed that these
								colour changes indicate the position of the marine angelfish,
								within the marine angelfish social hierarchy.
							<p>Marine angelfish graze on algae on coral reefs and rocks
								are well as eating smaller fish and crustaceans such as shrimp
								and small species of prawn . Adult marine angelfish are preyed
								upon by sharks, marine mammals and humans , but the young and
								smaller marine angelfish are eaten by many different species of
								animal both in the water and those based on land (such as
								birds).
