										</table> <span> <b> Walrus Classification and Evolution</b><br>
											The Walrus is a large marine mammal that is found inhabiting
											the freezing cold and icy waters of the Arctic Circle.
											Thought to be most closely related to Fur Seals , Seals ,
											Walruses are the second largest ocean-dwelling mammals that
											come ashore to breed after Elephant Seals and are highly
											distinctive amongst pinnipeds due to their sensitive whiskers
											and long tusks. There are two different species of Walrus
											that vary slightly in appearance but mainly in geographic
											location which are the Atlantic Walrus and the Pacific
											Walrus. However, it is widely debated as to whether or not
											there is actually a third species known as the Laptev Walrus
											that is found in the Laptev Sea, which many believe to simply
											be a population of Pacific Walruses that specifically inhabit
											the area. The Walrus is considered to be an increasingly
											vulnerable animal species although gathering data on these
											elusive creatures can be difficult so it is hard to determine
											exactly the current status of Walrus populations in the wild.
											<p>
												<b>Walrus Anatomy and Appearance</b><br> Walruses have
												large and elongated bodies that are wider at the head and
												neck and taper towards their tail which is embedded in a web
												of skin. Their tough and wrinkled skin is covered by a layer
												of sparse, coarse hairs and is generally grey or brown in
												colour. However, whilst sunbathing out of the water, the
												skin of the Walrus (which can be up to 4cm thick) develops a
												pink-red colouration. Walruses have two pairs of flippers
												that are used to help to propel these large animals with
												great agility through the water, with their bodies powered
												by their back flippers while the front flippers are used to
												steer them in the right direction. On land, they move about
												awkwardly on all fours, curling their back flippers
												underneath them at right angles to give them more support.
												The skin on the bottom of their flippers is rough and
												knobbly which helps to prevent these enormous animals from
												slipping on the ice. Walruses have long tusks (extra-long
												upper canine teeth) that are used for both fighting and to
												dig into the ice when they are pulling their heavy bodies
												out of the water.
											<p>
												<b>Walrus Distribution and Habitat</b><br> Walruses are
												found throughout the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans
												where they inhabit ice floes and rocky coastlines, along
												with spending a great deal of time in the freezing cold
												water. During the winter months when the ice is at it's
												thickest, Walruses tend to prefer areas of thinner ice that
												they can easily break through to the surface from the water
												underneath. In the warmer summer months when the ice
												recedes, Walruses can be found more commonly on remote areas
												of rocky coastline. Despite being well suited to the
												freezing conditions in the far north, Walruses have on
												occasion been known to venture further south in areas of
												Central Canada , around the United Kingdom and even as far
												as the waters close to the Spanish coast. They do however,
												spend most of their time in and around the Arctic Circle
												where they are becoming increasingly under-threat from
												global warming which is rapidly depleting the ice that these
												animals have learnt to rely on.
											<p>
												<b>Walrus Behaviour and Lifestyle</b><br> Walruses are
												incredibly sociable animals that live in large herds on the
												ice floes that can contain up to thousands of individuals
												and consist mainly on females (cows) with their young, along
												with a number of dominant males (bulls). When they retreat
												into the water to feed, these enormous herds break up into
												smaller bands numbering as few as ten individuals so there
												is less competition for food. Male Walruses are almost
												double the weight of their female counterparts and have much
												longer tusks which can grow up to a meter in length and are
												used primarily for fighting with competitors for the most
												favoured breeding sites and the females that reside there.
												They are known to make a variety of vocal sounds including
												loud bellows during the mating season that are easily and
												loudly produced thanks to the two pouches of air in their
												necks.
											<p>
												<b>Walrus Reproduction and Life Cycles</b><br> Walruses
												most commonly breed in the middle of winter between the
												months of January and March. After a gestation period that
												lasts for around 15 months, a single pup is born on the ice
												measuring up to 1.2 meters long and weighing up 75kg. Walrus
												pups have short and soft hair covering their bodies, pale
												grey flippers and a thick, white moustache with no visible
												teeth. They suckle only on their mother's milk for their
												first six months when they begin to eat more solid foods.
												After their first year, Walrus pups are almost triple the
												size they were at birth and begin to become more and more
												independent, although tend to remain very close to their
												incredibly protective mothers until they are two or three
												years old. Young females will often remain close to their
												mother but males begin to venture away from the herd to join
												all-male bachelor groups. Female Walruses are able to
												reproduce at around 6 or 7 years of age but males are not
												mature until they are at least 10 years old but will often
												not successfully reproduce until they can prove their
												dominance around 5 years later.
											<p>
												<b>Walrus Diet and </b><br> Walruses are carnivorous
												animals that only hunt and eat other animals in order to
												survive. They have a thick moustache containing roughly 450
												very sensitive whiskers that help them to find food in the
												dark and murky waters at depths of around 100 meters below
												the surface. Walruses find almost all of their on the ocean
												floor and are known to expel streams of both air and water
												into the sediment to reveal food hidden under the sand. They
												feed primarily by sucking food into their mouths rather than
												using their teeth to chew on it and are even known to grip
												shellfish between their lips and suck the soft creature out
												from inside the shell, before spitting the shell out into
												the water. Walruses feed on a variety of different prey
												species including clams, snails , worms, squid , octopuses
												and even some species of slow-moving fish . Some Walrus
												populations are also known to hunt seals.
											<p>
												<b>Walrus Predators and Threats</b><br> Due to the
												large size and aggressive nature of these marine mammals ,
												Walruses have few predators in their natural environments
												with the exception of pods of Killer Whales Whales and the
												occasional brave Polar Bear , Bear , as they can easily
												defend themselves with their enormous tusks. Humans are the
												most common predators of the Walrus as they are hunted for
												the meat, skin and oil by local populations (along with the
												less desirable hunting of them for their ivory from
												non-native people). They are also threatened in certain
												areas by water pollution including oil contamination that
												affects them directly but also through their prey , along
												with large fishing vessels that harvest the animals that the
												Walruses prey on and not only leave them with less food, but
												also cause severe noise pollution in the normally quiet and
												remote waters.
											<p>
												<b>Walrus Interesting Facts and Features</b><br>
												Walruses are incredibly well adapted to living in some of
												the coldest regions in the world with thick skin that covers
												a thick layer of blubber (fat) that helps to keep them warm.
												Their enormous tusks were originally thought to aid them
												when feeding but are know known to be more do with social
												status and even help with mobility. Walruses dig their tusks
												into ice floes to help them haul their enormous bodies out
												of the water but also anchor their tusks into the ice so
												they are able to sleep whilst their bodies remain submerged
												beneath the waves. Walruses are also known to use their long
												and powerful tusks like a pick-axe to carve their way
												through the thick ice. Walruses feed in the darkness of the
												ocean floor and are known to commonly dive to depths of
												between 80m and 100m for nearly half an hour at a time.
												However, recent studies show that depending on the
												availability of prey , Walruses have been known to reach
												much deeper depths of up to 180 meters below the surface of
												the water.
											<p>
												<b>Walrus Relationship with Humans</b><br> For
												thousands of years, local people have thought of Walruses as
												being very similar to humans as they are known to display
												qualities of intelligence, are slow to reproduce and take
												long and very good care of their more vulnerable young.
												Walruses have also been hunted by people in their native
												countries for thousands of years as a good source of food
												but in more recent years they have also been increasingly
												hunted for the ivory in their tusks, which is considered to
												be second in both size and quality only to those of
												elephants . Large scale hunting has decimated Walrus
												populations, particularly in certain areas but it is also
												increasing amounts of pollution that is having a devastating
												effect on wild populations.
											<p>
												<b>Walrus Conservation Status and Life Today</b><br>
												Today, the Walrus is considered to be species that is Near
												Threatened in it's natural environment although data is hard
												to gather on these bottom-feeding mammals . They have been
												declining in number since the 18th century with increasing
												levels of hunting and human activity and more recently are
												becoming increasingly threatened by the lessening amount of
												ice due to global warming. Although the exact population
												size is unknown, there are estimated to be between 200,000
												and 250,000 individuals remaining in the freezing waters of
												the Arctic Circle.</span>
